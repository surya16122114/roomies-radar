## Overview
Roomies Radar provides a streamlined solution for finding the perfect roommate and listing shared accommodations. It leverages a robust domain model and an OpenAPI-defined RESTful API to handle user registration, login, profile management, and property listings.

- Roomies Radar is a web platform designed to simplify the process of finding and booking accommodation for international students.
- The website connects current students who have available accommodations with new or international students looking for a place to stay.
- Roomie Finder offers a streamlined, user-friendly interface where students can browse, list, and book accommodations based on their preferences and budget.

## Domain Model

The Roomies Radar project is designed using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. Below are the main entities and relationships:

### Main Entities:
1. **User**: Represents the user of the application with details like name, email, phone number, and membership status.
2. **Profile**: Stores additional user information such as gender, age, education, preferences, and work experience.
3. **Preferences**: Defines roommate preferences, including gender, room type, and special requirements.
4. **WorkExperience**: Captures the user‚Äôs work history.
5. **Education**: Holds educational background details of the user.
6. **Post**: Represents a user-created post for finding roommates or listing properties.
7. **Listing**: Stores details of the property listing, including address, price, amenities, and availability.
8. **Address**: Defines the location details of a property.


### Relationships:
- A **Profile** belongs to a **User** and includes **WorkExperience**, **Preferences**, and **Education**.
- A **User** can create multiple **Posts** and be tagged in multiple posts.
- A **Post** has a **Listing**, and a **Listing** is located at an **Address**.
